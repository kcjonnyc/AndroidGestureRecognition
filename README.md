# AndroidGestureRecognition
App to recognize various gestures.

This app can reconize UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT gestures based on the accelerometer readings from an android device. Gestures are
determined a finite state machine with predefined threshold values. The threshold values may need to be adjusted for a different
android device. The code from this app can be used for development of future projects and allow for gesutre based control. 

This app was created for a lab in our programming course.
